# macropopsicle
An open source two key macro-pad modeled to look like a cartoony melting popsicle. 

## Description

### Mechanical / Case

The case consists of five pieces main pieces. These pieces have been designed for 3D printing however they could also be made through machining or other fabrication methods. 

Of the five pieces the two main halves, colored orange provide the majority of the structural support.

The keyplate is secured by four short bolts into the top case half. The white small bite piece is secured to the lower case half with a single bolt. The larger white piece secures first to the lower orange case half and then to the upper case half once fully assembled. The two halves are assembled togeather using three long bolts. 

Position the microcontroller in place using the tweezers if neccessary. 

All pieces which have bolts seated into them have holes designed to allow M3 bolts to screw into the plastic.

Once the popsicle case is assembled the keycaps and popsicle switch can be press fitted into place.
